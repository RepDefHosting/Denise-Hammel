With extensive experience as a New York healthcare professional, Denise Hammel serves as Hudson Valley Hospice’s palliative care director. Reporting on quality metrics, she undertakes the analysis of patient volume and census changes. These have a direct impact on aspects of operations such as staffing levels, expenses, and revenue. Overseeing the work of nurse practitioners, physicians, and social workers, Denise Hammel has helped steadily grow the operations.

Earning her bachelor’s degree in nursing at Chamberlain University in Chicago, Ms. Hammel gained early experience as a licensed practical nurse.
